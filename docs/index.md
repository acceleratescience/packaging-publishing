# Packaging and publishing python software for research

Welcome to the material on packaging and publishing python software.

There are three branches to this repo:

- `main` contains the slides and starting code, plus some details about how to work through the material.
- `basic` contains the basic starting code, and nothing else.
- `result` contains the final product, that you should hopefully put together yourself.

At the bottom of each section, you will find some further resources on the concepts discussed within.
