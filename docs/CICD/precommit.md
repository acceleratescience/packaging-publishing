We start with the pre-commit. This is our first line of defence against simple to correct errors in our code. pre-commit hooks let you customize Gitâ€™s internal behavior and trigger customizable actions at key points in the development life cycle. We can use this to run checks on our code before we commit it. This can include things like:
-   Code formatting
-   Linting
-   Typing checks
-   Import organization


## Packages

### `black`
[Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) enforces code formatting compliant with [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) enforces code formatting compliant with PEP 8 such as line lengths, indentations, blank lines, etc. It is customizable, so if you don't like certain line length restrictions, you can always change them. You can also tell `black` not to look in certain files, or ignore certain features.

### `flake8`
[Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/index.html#) checks for style and syntax errors. Usually used in conjunction with `black`, and you can also tell it to ignore things.

### `mypy`
[Mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) checks for typing errors, will help find potential problems with passing incorrect types, when type hints have been added in accordance with [PEP 484](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/).

### `isort`
[Isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) sorts your imports appropriately.

In order to ensure code consistency, we will run these checks every time we make a commit. This can be annoying, but it is for our own good!

## Setting up pre-commit
First, let's get out of our test venv for running the `streamlit` app. 
```bash
rm -rf venvTest
source .venv/bin/activate
```
We now need to make sure we add the required files to our project:
```
uv add --dev pre-commit black isort flake8 mypy
```

We must now make some changes to our `pyproject.toml` file:

```
[tool.black]
line-length = 88
exclude = '''
/(
      .eggs         
    | .git          
    | .hg
    | .mypy_cache
    | .tox
    | venv
    | _build
    | buck-out
    | build
    | dist
  )/
'''
```

Take it from me, we __DO NOT__ want our tools to try and alter the files in our virtual environment or distributions folders!

Similarly, for `isort`:
```
[tool.isort]
profile = "black"
line_length = 88
multi_line_output = 3
include_trailing_comma = true
virtual_env = "venv"
```

Unfortunately, `flake8` can't be configured inside the `pyproject.toml` file, so we have to create a separate file in our root directory called `.flake8`. In it, we add:

```
[flake8]
max-line-length = 88
```

### The pre-commit hook
Now we create a file in the root directory called `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, and add the following:
```yaml
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/psf/black
  rev: 24.3.0
  hooks:
  - id: black
- repo: https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8
  rev: 7.0.0
  hooks:
  - id: flake8
- repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy
  rev: v1.9.0
  hooks:
  - id: mypy
- repo: https://github.com/PyCQA/isort
  rev: 5.13.2
  hooks:
  - id: isort
```

## Trying it out
In the command line, we can run
```
pre-commit run --all-files
```;

and we should get the following (This may take a minute or two to run for the first time):
```
black....................................................................Passed
flake8...................................................................Passed
mypy.....................................................................Passed
isort....................................................................Passed
```

If there are any issues, work through them to fix the issues. Similarly when you use the VSCode UI to make a commit, any issues will be picked up.

Now in the `cancer_model.py` file, add the following import statement
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

You should get the following output when you run the pre-commit
```
black....................................................................Passed
flake8...................................................................Failed
- hook id: flake8
- exit code: 1

cancer_prediction/cancer_model.py:4:1: F401 'matplotlib.pyplot as plt' imported but unused

mypy.....................................................................Passed
isort....................................................................Passed
```

Now head into the `streamlit_app.py` file and in the `train_and_save_model() function, for the `filename` argument, change the type to `int`, so it reads:
```python
def train_and_save_model(train_data, filename: int = "cancer_model.pkl"):
```

This is nonsensical, since you are trying to pass a string as argument that should be an `int`! And sure enough, when you run the pre-commit, you get this complaint from `mymp`
```
black....................................................................Passed
flake8...................................................................Passed
mypy.....................................................................Failed
- hook id: mypy
- exit code: 1
